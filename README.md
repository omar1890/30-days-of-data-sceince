### Day3 : Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.
<br>
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.


### Day4 : Predicting Credit Card Approvals
Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.
<br>
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
